# Review the interface as one system

A strong interface is not six independent audits stapled together. Review the whole experience, let each `better-*` skill own its domain rules, then consolidate the evidence into one prioritized verdict. The same ownership runs forward: in `build` mode you consult the owners while implementing, then review your own diff against them.

This skill owns orchestration only. Accessibility rules belong to `better-accessibility`; structure to `better-layout`; copy to `better-writing`; type to `better-typography`; color to `better-colors`; visual polish and motion to `better-ui`. Never duplicate or override their rules here.

## Core Principles

### 1. Resolve Scope and Mode First

Infer the screen, flow, feature, or repository scope from the request and current workspace. State the resolved scope in the output. Use `core` when no mode is supplied and the request is a review; use `build` when the request is to implement something. `full` is opt-in — it dispatches a judge lane per domain with candidates and costs accordingly.

| Mode | Coverage | Finding cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quick` | Primary user path and highest-traffic states. Detect across all six domains; judge inline, no lanes. Report only `HIGH` and `MEDIUM` | 5 |
| `core` | Detect across all six domains, then judge **at most two**, selected by the rule below. Unjudged domains are reported `Detected only` | 8 |
| `full` | Entire requested scope, including empty, loading, error, and narrow-width states when present. Detect across all six domains and judge **every domain that produced candidates** — no cap | 15 |
| `build` | Implement the requested change, then self-review the diff against the domains it touches. Selected-domain, not a six-domain sweep | 15, scoped to the diff |

`core` is the deliberately cheap tier and is the only mode that leaves candidates unjudged.
`full` means fully reviewed: if a domain produced candidates, it gets a judge lane.

**Which two domains `core` judges.** Candidates carry no severity — assigning it is the judge's
job — so the selection cannot use one. Rank domains by, in order:

1. **Blocking potential.** Does the domain's `## Severity` ladder define `HIGH` as blocking a
   task or hiding content? `better-accessibility`, `better-layout`, and `better-writing` do;
   the other three define `HIGH` as unreadable or misleading output, which is serious but
   rarely blocks. Prefer a domain that can block.
2. **Candidate count at `high` confidence.** More high-confidence candidates means more for a
   judge to confirm or kill.
3. **The review order in Principle 3**, as the tie-breaker, so two runs on the same input pick
   the same two domains.

Say in **Scope and Coverage** which two you judged and why the others were left `Detected only`.
If the user named a concern, that domain is always one of the two.

**Which path `quick` inspects.** Use the project's own signal if one exists — an analytics
route list, a documented primary flow, the route the task names. Absent any signal, take the
entry point the change or the request touches and follow it to its first terminal state, and
say in the report that traffic evidence was unavailable.

If the requested scope is too large to inspect credibly, narrow it to the highest-traffic complete flow and state the boundary. Never imply uninspected surfaces were reviewed.

### 2. Recon Before Judgment

Identify the framework, styling system, component library, design tokens, supported viewports, and available preview or test commands. Follow the project's established Tailwind, plain CSS, CSS-in-JS, token, and component conventions.

Recon output is reusable. Pass it into every lane you dispatch so no lane re-derives the stack, and reuse it unchanged in `build` mode.

### 3. Use Domain Skills as the Sources of Truth

Before reviewing, confirm that all six owning skills below are available. Load and apply every available owner.

The three **review** modes — `quick`, `core`, `full` — sweep all six domains for candidates and differ only in how many of those domains get a judge lane, per the table in Principle 1. In `full` mode, every domain that produced candidates is judged before consolidation.

`build` is the exception: it is a **selected-domain** mode. A change touches the domains it touches, and sweeping the five you did not alter produces findings about code you did not write. Principle 14 governs how the selection is made and recorded; every domain still appears in the coverage table, with the unselected ones marked `Not in scope` and the reason.

Review in this order so foundational failures are not hidden by polish:

1. `better-accessibility`
2. `better-layout`
3. `better-writing`
4. `better-typography`
5. `better-colors`
6. `better-ui`

This skill owns the final response. When a domain skill is loaded through `better-interface`, apply its principles, its `## Severity` calibration, and its references, but ignore its standalone **Review Output Format**. Use the consolidated format, shared severity, and finding cap in this file instead.

If an owning skill is unavailable, mark that domain `Not reviewed`, name the missing skill, and continue with the remaining domains. Do not recreate its rules from memory, substitute a neighboring skill, or claim holistic coverage.

When two skills appear to cover the same issue, assign it to the skill that owns the underlying rule and mention secondary effects in the **Why** cell. Report it once.

### 4. Give Each Domain Its Own Context

Six rule sets plus the project's code crowd one context, and an invoked skill stays resident for the rest of the session. Keep domain rules out of this context whenever the host allows it.

Split the work by task type, not by domain. Every domain decomposes the same way:

| Tier | Nature | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Inventory** | Enumerate artifacts — interactive elements and their accessible names, rendered color pairs, type declarations, user-facing strings, breakpoints. Every claim carries `path/to/file:line`. No judgment. | The cheapest runtime that can read the tree |
| **Detect** | Apply a written, checkable rule to the inventory. Produces candidates, not findings: no severity, no rewrite. | A dispatched lane, or inline |
| **Judge** | Kill false positives against the source, assign severity, write the Before → After. | An `opus` lane, or this skill inline |
| **Consolidate** | Dedupe by root cause, rank, cap, record restraint, emit the verdict. | Always this skill, inline |

**Dispatching a lane is not cheap.** Measured on one 484-line component, a single detect lane
cost roughly **150k tokens and 14 minutes** at maximum reasoning effort — six of those is most
of a million tokens. What a lane buys is *depth and a clean context*, not savings: that run
traced into `node_modules` to check what the dialog primitive actually renders, which an inline
pass sharing context with five other rule sets will not do.

So dispatch is a deliberate spend and the mode ladder is a cost ladder. `quick` and `core` are
cheap because they **dispatch little or nothing**, not because detection is inherently cheap.
`core` judges at most two domains and must mark the rest `Detected only` — never `Clear`,
because an unjudged candidate is not the same as no candidate. `full` judges every domain with
candidates and is expensive by design; reach for it on a surface that matters.

Effort is selectable only on a lane dispatched to an external runtime with an explicit effort
flag. The Claude roles in `subagents/claude/` are pinned to `effort: high` deliberately, per
`model-routing`, and the Agent tool has no effort parameter to override at the call site. So
the modes differ by **how many lanes run**, not by reasoning tier. Record which tier actually
ran in **Scope and Coverage**; never run a shallower sweep and report it as full coverage.

The measurements, the high-versus-max comparison, and what the faster tier missed are in
[dispatch-cost.md](references/dispatch-cost.md).

### 5. Contract Every Lane

Each lane prompt states: the resolved scope, the recon results from Principle 2, the one domain skill it must load **and the absolute path to that skill's `SKILL.md`**, whether it is read-only, and the exact shape it must return. Lanes gather evidence; this skill decides.

The path is not redundant. A lane loads its rubric with the Skill tool, but a dispatched agent may not have that skill available under its host, and a lane that judges from memory is worse than one that reports it could not run. Give it both routes and require it to say which it used. Before dispatching, confirm the lane roles are actually installed; if they are not, run the passes inline rather than dispatching to a generic agent that has no rubric at all.

There are three distinct payloads, and using the wrong one is the most common way this breaks:

| Stage | Emits | Schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inventory + detect | **Candidates** — `locations`, `observed`, `rule`, `measurement`. Explicitly **no severity and no fix**; assigning either is judgment | [candidate-schema.json](references/candidate-schema.json) |
| Judge | **Findings** — the same root causes verified against source, now with `severity` and an actionable `after` | [findings-schema.json](references/findings-schema.json) |
| Consolidate | The merged report: coverage for all six domains, deduped findings, rejected candidates, **verification**, one verdict | [verified-schema.json](references/verified-schema.json) |

The two **lane** payloads share a root shape: `domain`, `evidence` (what was actually
inspected), the candidate or finding array, `rejected`, `verification`, and `blocked` (anything
in scope the lane could not inspect, or `"None"`). They differ only in that array.

The **consolidated** payload is a different shape and deliberately so: it is the parent's
synthesis, not a lane's report, so it has no single `domain` or `blocked` — per-domain state
lives in its `coverage` **object**, keyed by domain name with all six keys required, and
per-lane `blocked` is folded into that domain's
`state`. Do not send a lane payload where a consolidated one is expected.

Every field these schemas declare is **required**, including the ones that are conceptually
optional. Strict structured outputs cannot express an omitted key, so `measurement`,
`confidence`, `principle`, `verified`, and `degradedCoverage` are required-and-nullable: emit
`null`, never leave them out.

A detect or judge lane emits no verdict and applies no cap — six lanes each emitting `Block` is six reports, not one. The mode's finding cap is applied by this skill after consolidation, because a schema cannot see which mode is running.

`Rejected` is part of every contract because restraint cannot survive a lane boundary otherwise: a lane that discards its rejected candidates makes Principle 11 impossible to satisfy honestly. `Verification` is carried through consolidation for the same reason — the report mandates that section, so it cannot be dropped at the last hop.

**Evidence must be quotable, not merely asserted.** "The primitive does not set `aria-modal`" is a
claim; the grep or the quoted line that shows it is evidence. When a candidate rests on what a
dependency does, name the resolved version — a lockfile can install two copies of the same
package, and "the inspected implementation" is meaningless when there are two.

### 6. What Each Lane May Consult

The authority for a review is **the code as installed**, not the latest documentation. A
project pinned to an older version is correctly reviewed against that version; a finding
sourced from current docs is wrong if the pinned release behaves differently. So access is
asymmetric by stage:

| Stage | May consult | Must not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inventory, Detect | The repository and its installed dependencies, including reading inside `node_modules`. The lockfile decides which version is authoritative | External docs. Local source already settles these questions, and fetching adds latency to the stage that can least afford it |
| Judge | The above, plus package source and version-pinned API references to resolve a candidate the source alone cannot settle — is this deprecated in *this* version, is this the intended API | Substituting a docs claim for source evidence when the source is present and readable |
| `build` | Everything, and it should. Writing new code is where currency matters most: current APIs, current Baseline support, whether a pattern is still recommended | Introducing a feature the project's targets do not support without saying so |

When a lane does consult an external source, it cites the source and the version it applies to,
in the same `Verification` entry as the check. A judged finding that rests on documentation
rather than on the code in front of it must say so, so the reader can weigh it.

This table is a **correctness convention, not a sandbox**. A lane with shell access can reach
the network whatever this says; the rule exists so findings stay anchored to the version the
project actually installs, not to guarantee isolation. Treat a lane that ignores it as having
produced an unreliable finding, and check the `Verification` entries to tell.

### 7. Lane Failure Is Reported, Never Absorbed

- A lane that errored or returned unusable output is **degraded coverage**. Say so explicitly; the remaining lanes' findings stand alone.
- **`Approve` requires complete coverage.** If any domain is `Degraded`, `Not reviewed`, or `Detected only`, the verdict is `Inconclusive` even when every live lane came back clean — the unreviewed domain is exactly where the unfound problem would be. Name the missing domains and what it would take to close them.
- If every lane failed, there is **no verdict**. Report the failure and stop.
- Zero candidates across *all six* domains, with none degraded, is a real result: report `Approve` with no findings.

### 8. Require Evidence

Every finding cites `path/to/file:line` and shows the current implementation. If the review artifact has no source files, cite the exact screen and component. Do not report a code-level finding from visual appearance alone or a visual finding from source code alone when runtime behavior determines the result.

### 9. Rank by User Impact

Rank every finding on the shared scale in **## Severity** below, calibrated per domain by that domain skill's own `## Severity` section.

Within a severity, rank by reach and leverage. A token or shared-component fix outranks the same symptom in one leaf component.

### 10. Consolidate Systemic Findings

One root cause is one finding. List every confirmed location in the same row rather than producing a row per occurrence. Do not pad the report to reach the finding cap; a short review or no findings is a valid result.

### 11. Make Restraint Visible

Record candidates considered but deliberately rejected. A candidate is rejected when the owning skill permits the current implementation, evidence is insufficient, the project convention is intentional, or the proposed change would add complexity without user benefit.

### 12. Verify What Can Be Verified

Run safe, relevant checks available in the project. Inspect the rendered interface when runtime behavior or visual judgment matters. Report the exact command or interaction and observed result. If a check cannot be run, label it **Not verified** and state what remains; never convert a verification gap into a finding.

### 13. Review Without Mutating by Default

Treat a review request as read-only. Do not edit source code unless the user also asks to implement the findings, or the mode is `build`. When implementation is requested, preserve the consolidated report as the change scope and re-run the relevant verification afterward.

### 14. Build With the Same Owners

`build` mode runs the ownership table forward instead of backward. Review asks "what is wrong
with this"; build asks "what would make this right the first time". Same owners, same severity
scale, opposite direction.

#### 1. Recon, then name the domains in play

Principle 2's recon output is the input here, unchanged: framework, styling system, component
library, tokens, viewports, available checks. Then decide which domains the change actually
touches and say so before writing code.

Most changes touch three or four, not six. A form touches accessibility (labels, errors, focus
order) and writing (labels, error text), and layout only if it introduces structure. A
marketing section touches typography, layout, and color, and rarely accessibility beyond
headings and contrast. An icon button touches accessibility (accessible name, hit area) and
`better-ui` (stroke weight, states). Naming them is what makes step 4 checkable — an unnamed
domain is one you will not review.

#### 2. Consult the owners before implementing

Load each named owner and extract the constraints that bind *this* change **before** the first
line of code. Their principles are the spec, not a rubric to be graded against afterwards:
the type scale and its steps, the hit-area floor and which exception applies, the token names
for the roles you need, the copy voice and capitalisation policy, the reduced-motion rule.

Write those constraints down as the acceptance criteria for the change. Building first and
auditing second produces rework, and it biases the audit — you will not find a problem in code
you just wrote unless you decided in advance what "correct" meant.

#### 3. Implement inside the project's system

Use the existing styling system, component library, and tokens. Never introduce a second
styling approach, a second icon set, or a raw value that duplicates a mapped token.

Prefer extending a shared component over styling a leaf: a fix at the token or component level
applies everywhere the defect exists, which is the same reach-and-leverage rule Principle 9
uses for ranking findings.

This is the one mode that consults current documentation freely (Principle 6). New code should
use current APIs, and a pattern that was best practice three years ago often is not — but
check the feature against the project's stated browser targets before relying on it, and say
so when a choice depends on that.

#### 4. Self-review the diff

Review `git diff` against every domain named in step 1, using the same severity scale and the
same evidence standard. Scope is the diff, not the surrounding file: a pre-existing defect you
did not touch is out of scope, and reporting it as if you introduced it obscures what changed.

Fix anything you can fix immediately. Anything you deliberately leave becomes a
`Considered but Rejected` row with the reason — "the existing component has this defect
throughout and fixing it belongs in its own change" is a legitimate entry, and a far more
honest one than silence.

Self-review has a known weakness: you are checking your own work against criteria you chose.
The acceptance criteria from step 2 are the mitigation, because they were written before the
code existed. If a domain in play has no criteria from step 2, that is the gap to close first.

#### 5. Verify, then report

Run the checks per Principle 12 and report the exact commands and results. A build that
type-checks but was never rendered is `Not verified` on anything visual, and should say so.

Output the consolidated report scoped to the diff, capped at 15 findings, using the same verdict
ladder. All six domains still appear in the coverage table: the ones you selected carry their
result, and the ones you did not carry `Not in scope` plus the reason the change does not touch
them — "no user-facing copy changed", "no color or token was altered". That is what makes the
selection auditable instead of an omission.

`Approve` requires complete coverage **of the domains you selected**. A build whose
accessibility criteria were never checked is `Inconclusive`. A domain honestly marked
`Not in scope` does not block `Approve`; a domain you selected and then skipped does.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Six disconnected domain reports | Consolidate into one ranked findings table |
| Same issue reported by multiple skills | Assign it to the skill that owns the underlying rule |
| Finding with no exact location | Cite `path/to/file:line` and the current implementation |
| Visual claim inferred only from source | Inspect the rendered state or mark it not verified |
| Unlimited low-impact polish | Respect the mode cap; omit `LOW` findings in `quick` |
| Silent gaps in coverage | Show which domains and states were actually inspected |
| Missing owning skill silently treated as covered | Mark the domain `Not reviewed` and name the unavailable skill |
| All six rule sets loaded into one review context | Detect across all six, dispatch judge lanes only where candidates exist |
| A failed lane quietly omitted from the report | Report degraded coverage; a total lane failure is no verdict, never `Approve` |
| Lane output pasted through as the report | Consolidate every lane under this skill's cap and verdict |
| Taste judgment delegated to a non-Claude model | Detection may run anywhere; copy, visual, motion, and naming calls stay here |
| No rejected candidates | Include the required considered-but-rejected table |
| Review silently edits code | Stay read-only unless implementation was requested or the mode is `build` |
| Building first and consulting the domain skills afterward | Consult the owners in play before writing code |
| "Approve" with pending actionable findings | Use `Needs changes` or `Block` |

## Severity

One shared scale across all six domains. Each domain skill's own `## Severity` section
calibrates what these mean in its territory; this is the vocabulary they calibrate.

- `HIGH`: blocks a task, misleads the user, hides content or controls, causes data-loss risk, or creates a repeated systemic failure.
- `MEDIUM`: meaningfully harms comprehension, efficiency, adaptability, or consistency.
- `LOW`: isolated polish with limited task impact. Include only in `full` mode.

## Review Output Format

Always use the following sections.

### Scope and Coverage

State the mode, exact scope, stack and styling conventions, how the work was dispatched (inline or lanes), and any review boundary. Then show coverage:

| Domain | Evidence inspected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility | Files, components, states, or checks | Findings count or `Clear` |

Include all six domains. `Clear` means inspected with no actionable finding; `Detected only` means the domain was swept for candidates but no judge lane ran under the mode's cap; `Not reviewed` must explain why.

### Findings

Use one table ordered by severity, then reach and leverage:

| # | Severity | Domain | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | HIGH | Accessibility | `src/Dialog.tsx:42` | `<button><XIcon /></button>` | Add `aria-label="Close"` and hide the icon from the accessibility tree | The icon-only control has no accessible name |

Each row is one root cause. The **Domain** value is the owning skill without the `better-` prefix. Respect the mode's finding cap. If there are no findings, omit the table and state "No actionable interface findings."

### Considered but Rejected

Include 1–3 candidates in `quick` mode and 2–5 in `core`, `full`, and `build`:

| Location | Candidate | Rejected because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/Card.tsx:28` | Increase the shadow | Existing depth matches the shared surface token; changing one card would reduce consistency |

These are real candidates inspected during the review, not invented filler. If the scope genuinely contains fewer borderline candidates, include the ones that exist and say so.

### Verification

List each check or interaction, the exact command or steps, and the observed result. Separate checks that passed from checks marked **Not verified**.

### Verdict

End with exactly one:

- `Block` — one or more `HIGH` findings remain.
- `Needs changes` — only `MEDIUM` or `LOW` findings remain.
- `Inconclusive` — no actionable findings in what was judged, but at least one domain is `Degraded`, `Not reviewed`, or `Detected only`. Name them.
- `Approve` — no actionable findings remain and every domain that had to be inspected was inspected and judged. In `core` and `full`, that is all six domains; in `build`, it is every selected domain, and a domain honestly marked `Not in scope` does not block `Approve` (see Principle 14).
- `No verdict` — every lane failed.
