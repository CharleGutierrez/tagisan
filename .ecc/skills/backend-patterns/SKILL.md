# Enterprise Backend Resilience Patterns

## Patterns
1. Idempotency: Enforce idempotency keys on mutating endpoints to handle network retries safely.
2. Connection Pooling: Use robust pools with connection health checks, max lifespans, and acquisition timeouts.
3. Circuit Breakers: Guard upstream microservices with circuit breakers to prevent cascading system failures.
4. Graceful Shutdown: Handle `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` by draining active in-flight requests before terminating worker pools.
