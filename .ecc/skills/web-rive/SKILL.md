# Web Rive

Rive web and React runtime integration, .riv assets, state machines, inputs, lifecycle cleanup, accessibility, remote asset security, and fallback behavior.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Use web-lottie for Lottie/dotLottie assets.
- For React Native, prefer `expo-motion` when installed; otherwise proceed
  with the guidance here.
- Use Motion/GSAP/CSS when no .riv asset or state machine is involved.
- For general Motion/CSS API work or cross-stack audits, prefer `motion` or
  `design-motion-audit` when installed; otherwise proceed with the guidance
  here. Web R3F stays in-bundle via [`web-three-r3f`](../web-three-r3f/SKILL.md).

## Workflow

1. Inspect asset ownership, state machine names, inputs, autoplay, and runtime package.
2. Bind inputs through stable component state and cleanup runtime instances.
3. Add fallback and accessible semantics outside canvas.
4. Review URL actions and remote asset policy.

## Gotchas

- Canvas output is not self-describing to assistive tech.
- State machine input names are asset contracts; verify against the asset.
- Remote .riv files and URL actions need explicit allowlisting.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output web-rive-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
