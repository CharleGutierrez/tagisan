# Web Motion React

Motion React components and hooks: motion, AnimatePresence, layout animations, useScroll, useReducedMotion, gestures, variants, and React/Next boundaries.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Use GSAP for imperative timelines and plugin-heavy scenes.
- Use CSS for simple static transitions.
- Use WAAPI for low-level Animation object control outside React.
- For general Motion/CSS API work, native motion, or cross-stack audits,
  prefer `motion`, `expo-motion`, or `design-motion-audit` when installed;
  otherwise proceed with the guidance here. Web R3F stays in-bundle via
  [`web-three-r3f`](../web-three-r3f/SKILL.md).
## Workflow

1. Confirm package import path and React/client boundary.
2. Choose presence, layout, gesture, scroll, or value-based motion deliberately.
3. Respect reduced motion and state ownership.
4. Verify layout projection with resize, interruption, route changes, and hydration.

## Gotchas

- AnimatePresence requires stable keys and actual unmounts.
- Layout animations depend on stable layout boxes and should not fight CSS transitions.
- Do not push high-frequency motion values through React state.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output web-motion-react-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
