# Section 1: Overview & Operational Invariants

The `visio-headless-massive-graph-streaming-opt` skill provides automated developer capabilities for memory optimization and streaming techniques for generating 10,000-node graphs..
Rooted in authoritative knowledge from *Generating Visio Diagrams from Python via vsdx-python - Elena Vance*, this skill enforces deterministic vector geometry calculations, ShapeSheet mathematical invariants, and robust multi-page diagram automation.

## Operational Invariants

- **ALWAYS** validate ShapeSheet cell formulas, coordinate transformations, and spatial bounds before committing modifications to master shapes, stencils, or page instances.
- **NEVER** bypass connection point directional constraints, glue verification protocols, or event-driven error handlers that protect against cyclic recursion, #REF! errors, or process memory leaks.
- **MANDATORY** encapsulate all multi-step diagram mutations and batch ShapeSheet updates inside explicit undo scopes (`Application.BeginUndoScope` / `EndUndoScope`) or batch API transactions (`SetFormulas` / `context.sync()`) with automated rollback handlers.

# Section 2: Core Architecture & Workflow Execution

Operating within Cluster 15 (*Headless Diagram Synthesis via Node.js, Python & Canvas*), this skill enforces systematic visual execution patterns across Microsoft Visio 365 diagrams:

             │
             ▼
 [Vector Canvas & Telemetry Pipeline] ──► (SVG Render, Data Graphics, Audit Log)
```

### Execution Protocol
1. **Contract Ingestion:** Parse diagram requirements, vector schemas, or ShapeSheet formulas against Tagisan RFC-004 specifications.
2. **Spatial Alignment & Geometry Check:** Evaluate parent-child coordinate spaces, rotation origins, and connection point inward/outward directions.
3. **Execution & Undo Guard:** Apply geometric modifications and formula bindings inside a supervised undo scope, intercepting engine errors and recursion cycles.
4. **State Commitment & Visual Verification:** Persist shape properties, trigger dynamic layout re-routing if required, and emit vector render telemetry.

# Section 4: Validation Criteria & Brutal Verification

To pass automated quality gates within Tagisan ECC, this skill must satisfy:
1. **Disk Presence:** A valid `SKILL.md` file resides under `.ecc/skills/visio-headless-massive-graph-streaming-opt/` with intact YAML frontmatter.
2. **Compiler & Runtime Invariants:** Built-in registration within `src/ecc/skills.rs` with lowercase alias routing and domain mapping to `visio-365`.
3. **Vector & Formula Guarantees:** Zero unhandled errors (#REF!, #VALUE!) during ShapeSheet formula execution; guaranteed rollback upon simulated failure.
4. **Deterministic Dispatching:** The skill must rank as a top match under `tgs ecc skills -q "massive-graph-streaming"`.
