# Native Validation

Validation for native motion changes: Expo Doctor, expo install --check, EAS/development build risk, Jest/Reanimated setup, RN tests, platform smoke, and audit report closeout.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Use implementation skills for code changes first.
- Use this skill whenever native package/config/runtime risk is part of the task.
- Do not replace device proof with lint/typecheck for native runtime changes.

## Workflow

1. Identify package/config/native-risk surface.
2. Run audit doctor/scan and repo-native package checks.
3. Choose local test, simulator/device, development build, or EAS proof based on risk.
4. Report commands, skipped checks, and residual risk.

## Gotchas

- Expo-compatible package versions can lag npm latest.
- Expo Go proof is not enough for modules requiring a development build.
- Jest animation tests need Reanimated setup and fake-timer discipline.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output native-validation-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
