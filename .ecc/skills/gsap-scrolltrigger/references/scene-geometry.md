# Trigger geometry, pin, scrub, and refresh rules

Skill: gsap-scrolltrigger
Checked at: 2026-06-04

## When To Load

- Use this when start/end, pin spacing, markers, refresh, or layout changes are involved.


## Operating Guidance

GSAP ScrollTrigger scroll-linked animation, pinning, scrub, trigger callbacks, refresh/invalidation, responsive matchMedia scenes, and cleanup.

### Decision Boundaries

- Use CSS scroll-driven animations only when native browser support and declarative semantics fit.
- Use gsap-timeline for non-scroll sequencing.
- Use web-three-r3f for 3D scroll scenes.

### Workflow Details

1. Identify scroll container, trigger, start/end, pin, scrub, and responsive ownership.
2. Attach ScrollTrigger to a top-level tween or timeline.
3. Plan refresh ordering after fonts/images/layout changes.
4. Verify resize, route unmount, reduced motion, and mobile scroll.

### Gotchas

- Do not put ScrollTriggers inside child tweens of a nested timeline.
- Pinned scenes affect layout and need refresh proof.
- Route transitions must kill/revert triggers or scope them to a context.

## Validation Notes

- Inspect installed package versions and local architecture before applying examples.
- Prefer the bundled `scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root <repo> --format json` command when setup is unclear.
- Use `scripts/audit.mjs scan --root <repo> --format markdown` for repeatable static findings, then manually verify every finding against current code.
- Close with repo-specific checks and user-visible runtime proof when this skill affects a rendered surface.
