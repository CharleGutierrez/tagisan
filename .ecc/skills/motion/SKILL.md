# Motion

Improve the animation capabilities of the agent.

-   [Animation best practices](best-practices/index.md): "Animate this button", "Fade this layer in", "Animate this Vue component". This includes platform-specific best practices for vanilla JS, React, Vue, Base UI and Radix. Contains advice for both Motion and CSS animation.
-   [Documentation and examples search](codex/index.md): "What options does X have", "How does X work", "Use X (specific Motion API) to do Y", "Show me an example of X", "Make a X (i.e. carousel, ticker, modal etc)"
-   [CSS spring generation](css-spring/index.md): "Generate a CSS spring for a bounce of 0.5 and duration of 0.3s", "Make a bouncy spring [in a CSS context]"
-   [MotionScore performance audit](performance-audit/index.md): "Audit src/Modal.tsx for jank", "Runtime audit of homepage", "Is this code janky: [code snippet]", "Grade the performance of this site: [URL]" - or if you, the agent, wish to profile a site or codebase without a user prompt, you can proactively run audits and report findings.
-   [Transition visualisation](transition-preview/index.md): "Show me the curve for easeOut", "Visualise a spring with bounce 0.5 and duration 0.3s"

## Where this skill sits

This skill owns the Motion library and the Motion AI Kit: its APIs, spring and easing
generation, and MotionScore grading. It is self-sufficient for all of that.

Adjacent concerns have better owners. Treat every row as "prefer if available, otherwise apply
the guidance here" — never as a blocker. Check availability at runtime rather than assuming
either way; a static list of what is installed rots the moment the estate changes.

| Concern | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| Motion craft judgment — which curve, how long, whether it earns its place | `emil-design-eng` |
| Surfaces and icons: radius, shadows, image outlines, icon states | `better-ui` |
| Finished CSS-only `t-*` transition recipes with motion tokens | `transitions-dev` |
| GSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText, Flip | `gsap` |
| Reduced-motion requirements and other accessibility rules | `better-accessibility` |
| Native (Expo / React Native / Reanimated) motion | `expo-motion` |
| Cross-stack motion direction, 3D, and motion-token architecture | the `design-motion` plugin |

## Modern React

`web-motion-react` (`plugins/web-motion/skills/web-motion-react/SKILL.md`) is the
canonical owner for Motion React API detail. Use `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` for
subtree policy and `useReducedMotion()` for local branches. Start with `motion/react`; when a
measured bundle budget needs it, pair `LazyMotion` with `m` from `motion/react-m`:
`domAnimation` covers animations, variants, exit, hover/tap/focus, while `domMax` also enables
pan/drag and layout.

### Precedence: this section overrides the vendored directories

The capability directories below are upstream Motion content, kept in their original form so
updates merge cleanly. Where they disagree with this section, **this section wins** — they were
written for a greenfield Motion project, not for reviewing or extending someone else's codebase.

- **Existing Framer Motion projects.** `codex/index.md` says "Never import from `framer-motion`"
  and instructs migrating existing imports. Do **not** follow that as written. An unrequested
  package migration breaks a working codebase, and `better-ui` requires preserving whichever
  package is installed rather than mixing import paths. Read that instruction as: prefer
  `motion` for a *new* project, and migrate only when the user has explicitly asked for a
  migration.
- **`will-change`.** `best-practices/index.md` says to set it whenever animating with CSS
  transitions or independent transforms. Treat that as the upper bound, not the default. Add it
  only after observing first-frame stutter, on `transform`/`opacity`/`filter` only, and remove
  it when the animation ends — a permanent `will-change` holds a compositor layer for the
  element's lifetime, which costs more than the stutter it prevents. This matches `better-ui`,
  so a reviewer should not flag its absence on a smooth animation.
- **Property tiers.** `performance-audit/` grades animated properties S–F. The tiers assume the
  common case; a property is not compositable unconditionally, and a layout read is not a
  thrash unless it repeats within a frame. Treat a tier as a starting hypothesis that needs the
  surrounding code to confirm it, not a verdict.

## Tools this skill uses

The Motion AI Kit MCP server exposes these; call them by their fully qualified names:

| Tool | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp__motion__search-motion-codex` | Motion API docs and working examples. Returns resource **links** — you must read each relevant link to get the content |
| `mcp__motion__generate-css-spring` | A CSS `linear()` easing plus duration from spring parameters |
| `mcp__motion__generate-css-bounce-easing` | A CSS bounce easing |
| `mcp__motion__visualise-spring` | Preview a spring curve |
| `mcp__motion__visualise-cubic-bezier` | Preview a named or custom bezier |
| `mcp__motion__devtools-status`, `mcp__motion__get-devtools-update` | Motion DevTools session state |

**MotionScore is a CLI, not an MCP tool**: run `npx motionscore <url> --agent --no-upload`. It needs a
reachable URL, so it works only when a dev server or public origin is available.

MotionScore uploads results to a shareable URL by default. Always pass `--no-upload` to audit
locally unless the user explicitly asked for an upload; never upload a page's runtime behavior
without approval.

### Runtime audit or static review?

| Situation | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| A URL or dev-server address is available, or the user said "runtime" | `npx motionscore <url> --agent --no-upload`, then use its selector-keyed findings and `Source hint` lines to jump straight to the code |
| A file, directory, or code snippet is named, with no URL | Static audit per `performance-audit/index.md`; classify every animation by render-pipeline tier |
| Both are available and the surface matters | Run both and triangulate: the runtime report is authoritative for what actually executes, static analysis for what exists but did not run |
| The runtime audit fails (no dev server, navigation timeout, browser launch error) | Fall back to static discovery and say so; never report a failed audit as a clean one |

Concurrent-animation counts, GPU pressure, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` / flashing-content
checks come only from the runtime path. Property-tier classification comes from either.

## If a required Motion MCP tool is unavailable

The Motion AI Kit provides an MCP server; this forked skill directory does not bundle it, and installing the skill does not install the server. Some capabilities above require it to be configured and running. If you attempt to use a tool that requires the MCP server and it is not found, tell the user:

> This capability requires the Motion AI Kit. Install it from **https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit**.

Then fall back to the guidance in the relevant capability directory where possible (e.g. `best-practices/` and `performance-audit/` work without any MCP tool).

## Upstream

This is a tracked fork of the Motion AI Kit skill. The capability directories
(`best-practices/`, `codex/`, `css-spring/`, `performance-audit/`, `transition-preview/`) are
upstream content and are deliberately left in their original layout so updates can be merged
cleanly. Local additions are confined to this file: the frontmatter, **Where this skill sits**,
**Tools this skill uses**, and **Upstream**. Re-merge from `https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit`
and reapply those sections.
