# Web Lottie

lottie-web, dotLottie web components, animation JSON/dotLottie assets, player lifecycle, cleanup, renderer choice, accessibility, and asset validation.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- For React Native, prefer `expo-motion` when installed; otherwise proceed
  with the guidance here.
- Use Rive for interactive state machines.
- Use CSS/WAAPI for simple UI motion that does not need designer-authored assets.
- For general Motion/CSS API work or cross-stack audits, prefer `motion` or
  `design-motion-audit` when installed; otherwise proceed with the guidance
  here. Web R3F stays in-bundle via [`web-three-r3f`](../web-three-r3f/SKILL.md).

## Workflow

1. Inspect asset format, player package, renderer, autoplay/loop, and hosting path.
2. Create and destroy player instances at the owner boundary.
3. Respect reduced motion and provide non-canvas semantics.
4. Validate asset size, remote URLs, and event listeners.

## Gotchas

- Canvas-rendered animation needs external accessible text or labels.
- Remote animation URLs need CSP/cache/security review.
- Looping/autoplay assets require reduced-motion and pause behavior.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output web-lottie-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
