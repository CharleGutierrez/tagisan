# New Branch

1. Before any other work, inspect the current branch/worktree state.
2. Create and checkout a new branch for the task using a conventional-commit and semver-compliant name, keeping it short and scoped, for example `feat/add-x`, `fix/y`, or `chore/z`.
3. Stop after switching to the new branch unless the user separately asks for implementation work.
4. In chat, provide the complete plan for work to be done on that branch and its pull request: intended changes, key files, verification, commit shape, and any risks or blockers.
