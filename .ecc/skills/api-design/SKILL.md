# ECC API Design

## Principles
1. Explicit over Implicit: Design function signatures where failure modes are represented in types (`Result`, `Option`).
2. Least Astonishment: Follow canonical idioms of the host programming language.
3. Extensibility: Use the builder pattern or options structs for functions with many parameters.
4. Documentation: Document every public struct, enum, and function with doc comments and usage examples.
