# Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture

## Architectural Invariants
1. Core Domain Independence: Pure domain logic must have zero dependencies on frameworks, databases, or network protocols.
2. Ports as Traits/Interfaces: Define primary (driving) and secondary (driven) ports as language-native abstractions (`trait` / `interface`).
3. Adapters in Isolation: Database clients, HTTP endpoints, and CLI handlers live in distinct adapter modules wrapping ports.
4. Testability: The domain layer must be 100% unit-testable in memory without databases or external servers.
