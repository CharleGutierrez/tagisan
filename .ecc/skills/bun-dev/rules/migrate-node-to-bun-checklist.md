# migrate-node-to-bun-checklist

## Why

Node -> Bun migrations are usually straightforward, but toolchain drift (lockfiles,
scripts, TS config) is the most common failure mode.

## Do

- Install/upgrade Bun.
- Remove Node package-manager lockfiles and install artifacts.
- Install dependencies with Bun and commit `bun.lock`.
- Update scripts to use `bun run` / `bunx`.
- Add Bun types (`@types/bun`) and confirm TS config.
- Run your full verification suite.

## Don't

- Don't keep multiple lockfiles "for compatibility".
- Don't assume every Node package behaves identically under Bun without running tests.

## Checklist

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml yarn.lock bun.lockb
bun install            # writes bun.lock
bun add -d @types/bun
bun test
```
