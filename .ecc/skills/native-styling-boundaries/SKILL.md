# Native Styling Boundaries

NativeWind, react-native-css, Tailwind-style classes in React Native, static class safety, design tokens, Reanimated/CSS transition boundaries, and Expo setup.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Use native-motion-core for Reanimated implementation logic.
- Use web-tailwind-motion for browser Tailwind.
- Do not generate untrusted runtime class strings.

## Workflow

1. Inspect NativeWind/react-native-css versions and Babel/Metro setup.
2. Keep classes statically discoverable and token-driven.
3. Choose style/class ownership before adding Reanimated or CSS transitions.
4. Validate iOS/Android/web behavior where NativeWind support differs.

## Gotchas

- Web Tailwind assumptions do not always map to React Native style props.
- Runtime string concatenation can break class extraction and policy.
- Animation ownership should not be split between NativeWind classes and Reanimated shared values.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output native-styling-boundaries-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
