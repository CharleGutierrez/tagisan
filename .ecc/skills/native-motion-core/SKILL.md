# Native Motion Core

Expo and React Native product motion with Reanimated 4, Worklets, shared values, animated styles/props, gestures, scroll handlers, layout animations, CSS transitions, and migration boundaries.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Use native-validation for command/device proof.
- Use native-skia for canvas-heavy effects.
- Use native-lottie/native-rive for designer-authored assets.

## Workflow

1. Inspect Expo SDK, RN, Reanimated, Worklets, Gesture Handler, Babel config, and New Architecture mode.
2. Pick the smallest primitive: RN state/style, Reanimated CSS, shared values, gestures, scroll, or layout animation.
3. Keep product state in React/store and transient motion in shared values.
4. Validate interruption, unmount, reduced motion, and iOS/Android behavior.

## Gotchas

- Reanimated 4 requires compatible Worklets and New Architecture; Reanimated 3 advice differs.
- Functions passed to scheduleOnRN must be defined on the RN runtime, not inside a worklet.
- Reading sharedValue.value on JS can block; derive/consume on the UI thread.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output native-motion-core-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
