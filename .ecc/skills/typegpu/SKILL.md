# TypeGPU

TypeGPU schemas, typed buffers/textures, shader functions, pipelines, WebGPU capability checks, and CPU/GPU resource ownership.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Do not trigger for raw WebGPU without TypeGPU imports.
- Use [`web-three-r3f`](../web-three-r3f/SKILL.md) for Three/R3F scenes.
- For React Native GPU surfaces, general Motion/CSS API work, or cross-stack
  motion audits, prefer `expo-motion`, `motion`, or `design-motion-audit` when
  installed; otherwise proceed with the guidance here.

## Workflow

1. Check installed typegpu, unplugin-typegpu, @webgpu/types, tsover, and browser/runtime support.
2. Define schemas before resources and shader signatures.
3. Keep root/device/resource ownership explicit.
4. Validate unsupported-browser fallback, reduced-motion/static quality, and GPU cleanup.

## Gotchas

- A d.* schema is the CPU layout, GPU layout, and TypeScript type source of truth.
- TypeScript shader functions require unplugin-typegpu; WGSL-only usage may not.
- Do not allocate buffers, textures, bind groups, or pipelines per frame unless measured and cached.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output typegpu-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
