# Hotspot optimizer

Find and (on request) fix complexity/performance hotspots with **behavior preserved and proven by
tests**. Bias toward small, verified wins over broad rewrites.

## Core rule

Never change observable behavior. Every optimization preserves outputs, ordering, error semantics,
and public APIs — and is proven by a test that passed before and after.

## Loop: Triage → Prove → Optimize → Verify

1. **Triage** — get candidate leads fast, then reason about them:
   - First pass (cheap, optional): `python3 scripts/scan_hotspots.py <root> --format json` for a
     ranked multi-language lead list. Treat output as *leads, not proof*.
   - Confirm with `Grep`/`Glob`/`Read`: nested loops over the same data, membership tests in a loop
     (list vs set), sort-in-loop, pairwise comparisons, repeated scans, render recomputation, N+1
     queries. Rank by impact (hot path × input size), not raw count.
2. **Prove** — before touching hot code, run/author a focused test that pins current behavior and, if
   feasible, a quick timing or complexity witness.
3. **Optimize** — apply the smallest localized `Edit` that lowers complexity (see
   `references/optimization-playbook.md`). No drive-by refactors or formatting churn.
4. **Verify** — re-run the focused test, then the broad gates (type-check, lint, build, suite). If any
   regresses, revert that change.

## Subagent fan-out

For large repos, shard files/dirs across `Task` subagents (read-only). Each returns a ranked findings
list: `file:line`, pattern, estimated current → target complexity, risk. The main agent dedupes and
merges into one ranked plan, then optimizes serially (it owns all edits). Cap concurrency at ~4-6
subagents; prefer fewer, broader shards over many tiny ones.

## Optimization safety checklist

- Same outputs for the same inputs (including ordering and ties).
- No swallowed/altered exceptions; same error types.
- No new unbounded memory (a set/dict cache must be bounded by the same data).
- Equivalent for empty / single / duplicate / large inputs.
- Public API and call sites unchanged.

## Analysis-only by default

Default to a report (see `references/report-template.md`): ranked findings with location, current and
target complexity, risk, and a proposed fix — **but do not edit**. Apply fixes only when the user says
implement / fix / apply / refactor (or pre-approves low-risk wins like list→set membership).
