# Web Three R3F

Three.js, React Three Fiber, Drei, Canvas/createRoot lifecycle, loaders, GLTF, useFrame, disposal, SSR/client boundaries, DPR, and browser proof.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Use typegpu for typed WebGPU pipelines.
- Use expo-motion for Expo / React Native (Three.js / R3F on native).
- Use CSS 3D transforms only for simple DOM transforms.
- For cinematic look-dev / art-direction of an already-working scene
  (postprocessing, HDRI, tone mapping, lighting, camera choreography), route to
  r3f-scene-polish. This skill owns Canvas/createRoot lifecycle, loaders,
  disposal, SSR/client boundaries, and DPR.

## Workflow

1. Inspect Three/R3F/Drei/React versions and asset pipeline.
2. Choose Canvas/R3F or plain Three renderer based on local ownership.
3. Reserve stable layout, DPR, fallback, and reduced-motion behavior.
4. Verify nonblank pixels, resize, interaction, asset errors, and cleanup.

## Gotchas

- Undefined parent height causes blank canvases.
- React state inside useFrame causes frame-loop reconciliation.
- R3F auto-disposal does not cover every primitive or externally created object.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output web-three-r3f-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and browser proof for the changed surface. **Browser proof
(optional tools — degrade and state what stays unverified if absent):** drive the
running scene with the `playwright-cli` skill — `eval` a `<canvas>` readback to
prove non-blank pixels, `resize` for responsive behavior, exercise interaction, and
`screenshot`/`video` the result; capture `console`/`requests` for asset or WebGL
errors. For a fuller motion frame-budget / reduced-motion pass, use the
`design-motion-audit` skill's runtime-verification reference. Report commands run,
findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons, and residual risk.
