# Native Accessibility Performance

Expo/React Native motion accessibility, reduced motion, haptics, UI-thread performance, frame pressure, gestures, and manual device proof.

## Operating Contract

Use this skill as a compact router plus domain checklist. Load references only
when the current task matches their condition. Do not cite local scrape paths,
machine cache paths, or hidden source locations. Verify API details against the
target repo's installed package versions before editing.

## Source Order

1. Inspect the target repo's installed packages, framework/runtime versions,
   local design tokens, accessibility policy, and existing motion patterns.
2. Use the bundled references below for skill-specific gotchas and copied source
   excerpts.
3. Use official current docs/package source as API truth when local code or
   bundled notes are version-sensitive.

## Decision Boundaries

- Prefer native-motion-core for implementation patterns.
- Route command and device validation gates through native-validation.
- Load native-skia or native-three-r3f for canvas/GPU-specific performance.

## Workflow

1. Inspect platform, Expo SDK, animation engine, and accessibility setting ownership.
2. Classify UI-thread, JS-thread, layout, and GPU work.
3. Add reduced-motion or static behavior without removing functional feedback.
4. Validate on iOS/Android or document skipped device proof.

## Gotchas

- Reduced motion should not remove essential progress, focus, pressed, or error feedback.
- Haptics are feedback, not a substitute for visible state.
- Per-frame React state updates can destroy native animation performance.

## Audit CLI

```bash
node scripts/audit.mjs doctor --root . --format json
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format markdown
node scripts/audit.mjs scan --root . --format json --output native-accessibility-performance-audit.json
```

Treat script findings as leads. Verify every finding against current code before
changing behavior or reporting it as valid.

## Closeout

Before finalizing, run the repo's focused validation command, this skill's audit
CLI when relevant, and any browser/device/manual proof required by the changed
surface. Report commands run, findings fixed, findings skipped with reasons,
and residual risk.
