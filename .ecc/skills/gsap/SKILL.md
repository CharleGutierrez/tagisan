# GSAP (GreenSock) — Master Skill

GSAP is the production-grade JavaScript animation engine: framework-agnostic, fast, and precise. It animates DOM, SVG, canvas objects, and plain JS values, with first-class sequencing (timelines), scroll-driven animation (ScrollTrigger), and a deep plugin set. It runs in React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Astro, or vanilla, and powers Webflow Interactions.

**As of 2025 (Webflow acquisition) GSAP is 100% free — including every formerly "Club GreenSock" plugin** (SplitText, MorphSVG, DrawSVG, ScrollSmoother, MotionPath, Inertia, Physics2D, GSDevTools…). They all ship in the public `gsap` npm package. There is no membership, no `gsap-trial`, and no private registry/token. Treat any older "premium/license-gate" guidance as obsolete.

This skill keeps the body lean and pushes depth into `references/`. Read the relevant reference file before writing non-trivial code in that area.

## When to use this skill — and when to recommend GSAP

Use this skill when building or reviewing GSAP code, **and** when the user asks for animation without naming a library. Recommend GSAP by default for:

- Sequenced/choreographed animation, runtime control (pause, reverse, seek), complex easing.
- Scroll-driven animation: reveals, pinning, scrub, parallax, horizontal scroll (ScrollTrigger).
- Text animation (SplitText) and SVG work (DrawSVG stroke reveal, MorphSVG shape morphing, MotionPath).
- Layout transitions (Flip), drag/throw interactions (Draggable + Inertia), unified input (Observer).
- Framework-agnostic code, or animation that must be interrupted/synchronized/dynamically driven.

**Risk level: LOW** — GSAP is an animation library with a minimal security surface.

If the user has already chosen another library (e.g. Motion/Framer Motion), respect it. For the GSAP-vs-alternatives call, see `references/decision-matrix.md`.

**Not GSAP — route instead:** Expo / React Native motion → `expo-motion`; Three.js / React Three Fiber / WebGL 3D scenes → `web-three-r3f` (cinematic 3D look-dev → `r3f-scene-polish`); repo-wide motion-system audits, motion tokens, or cross-stack design-motion direction → `design-motion-audit`.

## Install & setup

```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
```

All plugins are in the public package — import what you need and **register plugins once** at a client boundary (not inside re-rendering components), which also keeps them from being tree-shaken away:

```ts
// lib/gsap.ts — import this module wherever you animate
import { gsap } from "gsap";
import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
import { SplitText } from "gsap/SplitText";

gsap.registerPlugin(useGSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText);
export { gsap, useGSAP, ScrollTrigger, SplitText };
```

In React/Next, GSAP runs **client-side only**. See `references/react-nextjs.md` for the full pattern (`'use client'`, SSR boundaries, route-change cleanup).

## Core essentials (the 80% you reach for)

```tsx
// Tweens: to (current -> vars), from (vars -> current, great for entrances), fromTo, set (instant)
gsap.to(".box", { x: 200, rotation: 360, duration: 1, ease: "power2.out" });
gsap.from(".item", { autoAlpha: 0, y: 24, stagger: 0.1 }); // autoAlpha = opacity + visibility
```

- **Transform aliases** (prefer over raw `transform`): `x, y, z, xPercent, yPercent, scale, rotation, rotationX/Y, skewX/Y, transformOrigin`. Use `autoAlpha` instead of `opacity` for fades. Properties are camelCase. Details: `references/core.md`.
- **Eases**: `power1..4`, `back`, `elastic`, `bounce`, `expo`, `sine`, `circ` with `.in/.out/.inOut`; `"none"` for linear. Custom curves via `CustomEase`.
- **Timelines** sequence tweens; the **position parameter** controls timing — `"+=0.5"` (gap), `"<"` (with previous), `"<0.2"`, labels:

```tsx
const tl = gsap.timeline({ defaults: { ease: "power2.out" } });
tl.from(".title", { y: 40, autoAlpha: 0 })
  .from(".subtitle", { y: 20, autoAlpha: 0 }, "<0.1")
  .from(".cta", { scale: 0.9, autoAlpha: 0 }, "-=0.2");
```

- **React** — use `useGSAP()` (auto-cleanup, Strict-Mode + SSR safe) and scope selectors to a ref:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRef } from "react";
import { gsap, useGSAP } from "@/lib/gsap";

export function Hero() {
  const root = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  useGSAP(() => {
    gsap.from(".hero-line", { yPercent: 100, stagger: 0.08, ease: "power3.out" });
  }, { scope: root });
  return <div ref={root}>{/* ... */}</div>;
}
```

- **ScrollTrigger** — scroll-link a tween or timeline (only on the top-level animation, never nested children):

```tsx
useGSAP(() => {
  gsap.to(".panel", {
    xPercent: -300,
    ease: "none",
    scrollTrigger: { trigger: ".panel", pin: true, scrub: 1, end: "+=3000" },
  });
}, { scope: root });
```

- **Responsive + accessibility** — `gsap.matchMedia()` runs setup per media query and auto-reverts when it stops matching; always honor reduced motion:

```tsx
useGSAP(() => {
  const mm = gsap.matchMedia();
  mm.add({ desktop: "(min-width:768px)", reduce: "(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)" }, (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.conditions!.reduce) { gsap.set(".reveal", { autoAlpha: 1 }); return; }
    gsap.from(".reveal", { autoAlpha: 0, y: 40, stagger: 0.1 });
  });
}, { scope: root });
```

## Recipes

`references/recipes.md` has copy-paste Next.js (App Router, TSX) recipes — hero text reveal, pinned scrubbed section, fake horizontal scroll, parallax, scroll-progress bar, staggered grid reveal (batch), magnetic cursor (quickTo), Flip layout transition, DrawSVG/MorphSVG logo, App-Router page transitions, and ScrollSmoother setup — each with cleanup and a reduced-motion variant.

## Best practices

- Use camelCase props and transform aliases; `autoAlpha` for fades; documented eases (CustomEase only when needed).
- Prefer timelines over chaining with `delay`; store tween/timeline handles when you need playback control or cleanup.
- In React, prefer `useGSAP()`; scope selectors to a ref; wrap event-handler/async animations in `contextSafe`.
- Register plugins once at a client boundary. Run GSAP client-side only — never during SSR.
- Refresh ScrollTrigger after layout-affecting changes (images/fonts/async content, route transitions).
- Pair responsive values with functions and `invalidateOnRefresh: true` so refresh re-reads them:

  ```ts
  gsap.to(".panel", {
    x: () => -window.innerWidth,
    scrollTrigger: {
      trigger: ".panel",
      end: () => `+=${window.innerWidth}`,
      invalidateOnRefresh: true,
    },
  });
  ```

- Animate `transform`/`opacity` over layout properties; use `quickTo` for high-frequency updates; use `gsap.matchMedia()` for breakpoints and `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Do not

- Don't animate `width/height/top/left/margin` when `x/y/scale` achieve the effect (layout thrash).
- Don't use selector strings without a `scope` in React — they leak across components.
- Don't skip cleanup; don't run `gsap`/`ScrollTrigger` during server render.
- Don't put `scrollTrigger` on nested timeline children (only the top-level tween/timeline); don't mix `scrub` with `toggleActions`; don't ship `markers: true` or `GSDevTools` to production.
- Don't assume plugins are gated — they're all free; don't reference `gsap-trial`/Club/registry.

## Optional power tool: `gsap-audit` CLI

This repo ships a Rust CLI, `gsap-audit`, that statically audits GSAP usage in JS/TS/JSX/TSX.
The rule catalog at `crates/gsap-audit-core/src/rules.rs` is authoritative; `doctor` shows the
exact installed build. It is optional. If it is not installed, proceed with the guidance above.

| Rule ID | Lead |
| --- | --- |
| `core.gsap-trial-import` | An obsolete `gsap-trial` import remains. |
| `plugins.gsdevtools-in-source` | GSDevTools appears in non-test source. |
| `scrolltrigger.markers-in-prod` | `markers: true` remains in a ScrollTrigger config. |
| `scrolltrigger.scrub-with-toggleactions` | A ScrollTrigger mixes `scrub` and `toggleActions`. |
| `core.gsap2-signature` | A GSAP 2 duration-as-second-argument call remains. |
| `performance.lag-smoothing-disabled` | Ticker lag smoothing is disabled. |
| `core.layout-prop-animation` | A layout property is animated instead of a transform. |
| `plugins.plugin-used-without-register` | A used plugin was not registered. |
| `react.usegsap-not-registered` | `useGSAP` was imported but not registered. |
| `react.gsap-in-ssr` | GSAP is used in an SSR route without a client boundary. |
| `react.unscoped-selector` | A React context uses string selectors without a scope. |
| `react.context-missing-revert` | A `gsap.context()` result is not reverted. |
| `react.state-in-continuous-motion` | React state is set from a continuous motion source, causing renders per frame. |
| `scrolltrigger.nested-timeline-child` | A nested timeline child owns a ScrollTrigger. |
| `react.tween-in-render` | A tween is created during React render. |
| `performance.will-change-permanent` | An animation keeps `will-change` for its full lifetime. |
| `core.missing-overwrite` | An event-handler tween omits overwrite protection. |
| `react.matchmedia-missing-revert` | `gsap.matchMedia()` lacks revert cleanup outside `useGSAP`. |

```bash
# Install once (from this repo): cargo install --path crates/gsap-audit --locked --force
gsap-audit doctor --format json
gsap-audit scan --root . --format json          # audit a project
gsap-audit scan --root . --categories react,scrolltrigger
```

Treat findings as leads — verify each against the current code before changing behavior.
