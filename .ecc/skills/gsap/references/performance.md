# GSAP Performance

> **Compatibility baseline:** `gsap@3.15`; where React is used, `@gsap/react@2.x`. Explicit earlier versions below are feature-introduction notes.

Smooth 60fps animation is mostly about animating cheap properties, promoting layers sparingly, and never doing layout work on the hot path. GSAP is fast by default. The wins below come from feeding it the right properties and cleaning up after yourself, not from licensing tiers (GSAP is 100% free and open).

## The property-cost mental model

Every animated property falls into one of four buckets. The browser runs the pipeline top-to-bottom; the lower a property triggers, the more work per frame:

| Cost tier | What runs each frame | GSAP properties | Verdict |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Composite** (cheapest) | GPU layer transform/blend only | `x`, `y`, `z`, `xPercent`, `yPercent`, `scale`, `scaleX/Y`, `rotation`, `rotationX/Y`, `skewX/Y`, `opacity`/`autoAlpha` | Animate freely — the 60fps fast path |
| **Paint** | Re-rasterize pixels (no reflow) | `backgroundColor`, `color`, `boxShadow`, `filter`, `borderRadius`, `clipPath` | OK in moderation; paint-heavy on large areas |
| **Layout** (most expensive) | Reflow the geometry of the page | `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `margin`, `padding`, `fontSize` | Avoid on the hot path — causes jank |
| **JavaScript** | Your `onUpdate` / callbacks | function-based values, plugins, scroll callbacks | Keep callbacks tiny; never read layout inside them |

Rule of thumb: if a transform alias can produce the same visual result as a layout property, use the transform. Promoting an element to a composited layer is not free either — a large layer trades layout cost for memory, texture upload, blending, and (for text) re-rasterization cost. Measure paint-heavy effects (`filter`, `boxShadow`, large blurs) rather than assuming they composite cheaply.

## Prefer transform and opacity

Animating **transform** (`x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotation`, `skew`) and **opacity** keeps work on the compositor and skips layout and most paint. GSAP's `x`/`y` use `translate()` under the hood, so reach for them instead of `left`/`top` for movement.

```tsx
// Good — composited, stays on the GPU
gsap.to(".card", { x: 200, scale: 1.1, autoAlpha: 1, duration: 0.6 });

// Avoid — every frame reflows the page
gsap.to(".card", { left: 200, width: 320, marginTop: 40, duration: 0.6 });
```

Prefer `autoAlpha` over raw `opacity` for fades: at `0` it also sets `visibility: hidden`, so the element costs nothing to render and stops intercepting clicks. See [Core API](./core.md).

## will-change discipline

`will-change: transform` hints the browser to promote an element to its own layer ahead of time. It is a **scoped** hint, not a global optimization — set it on too many elements and you blow the layer budget, spike GPU memory, and make things slower.

- Promote **only** elements that are actively animating, and **only** for the lifetime of the effect.
- Add it just before the animation and remove it on completion/cleanup.
- Never ship a global rule (`* { will-change: transform }` or a shared component class) — that is the most common will-change mistake.
- Treat `force3D`, `translateZ(0)`, and similar promotion hacks as measured exceptions, not defaults. They do not substitute for reducing animated area or paint cost.

```tsx
const tween = gsap.to(el, {
  x: 300,
  duration: 0.8,
  onStart: () => { el.style.willChange = "transform"; },
  onComplete: () => { el.style.willChange = "auto"; }, // release the layer
});
```

For repeating/idle UI, leave `will-change` off until the interaction begins.

## Batch reads and writes (avoid layout thrash)

Layout thrash happens when you interleave DOM **reads** (anything that forces the browser to recompute geometry — `offsetWidth`, `getBoundingClientRect`, `scrollTop`, computed styles) with **writes** (style changes) in a loop, forcing a synchronous reflow each iteration.

GSAP already batches its own writes across all tweens into one flush per frame. The danger is **your** code around it. Do **all reads first, then all writes**:

```tsx
// Bad — read, write, read, write... forces reflow each loop
items.forEach((el) => {
  const w = el.offsetWidth;          // read (reflow)
  gsap.set(el, { x: w / 2 });        // write
});

// Good — batch reads, then batch writes
const widths = items.map((el) => el.offsetWidth); // all reads
items.forEach((el, i) => gsap.set(el, { x: widths[i] / 2 })); // all writes
```

Inside `onUpdate` and scroll callbacks this matters most — never call `getBoundingClientRect()` per frame. Cache measured values and recompute only on resize/refresh.

## Stagger vs manual delay chains

When many elements share the same animation, use **`stagger`** instead of N separate tweens with incrementing `delay`. One tween with a stagger is one instance for GSAP to track, schedule, and clean up — cheaper to create and far easier to kill or reverse as a unit.

```tsx
// Good — one tween, GSAP spreads the start times
gsap.from(".item", { y: 24, autoAlpha: 0, stagger: 0.06, duration: 0.4 });

// Avoid — N tweens, N delays, N handles to manage
items.forEach((el, i) => gsap.from(el, { y: 24, autoAlpha: 0, delay: i * 0.06 }));
```

For long lists, animate only visible items (virtualization or an IntersectionObserver) rather than instantiating hundreds of tweens at once. Use a [Timeline](./timeline.md) when steps must overlap with precise offsets, and reuse it — don't build new timelines every frame.

## High-frequency updates: quickTo / quickSetter

For values updated many times per second (mouse followers, scroll-linked position, pointer parallax), creating a fresh tween on every event is wasteful. Reuse **one** tween:

- **`gsap.quickTo(target, property, vars)`** — returns a function that animates `property` toward the latest value with easing/inertia. Ideal for smooth, lagging followers.
- **`gsap.quickSetter(target, property, unit?)`** — returns a function that writes the value **instantly** (no tween). Use when you don't want easing, just the cheapest possible per-frame write.

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRef } from "react";
import gsap from "gsap";
import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";

export function MouseFollower() {
  const dot = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useGSAP(() => {
    const el = dot.current!;
    // Build the setters ONCE, reuse on every move — no per-event tween churn
    const xTo = gsap.quickTo(el, "x", { duration: 0.4, ease: "power3" });
    const yTo = gsap.quickTo(el, "y", { duration: 0.4, ease: "power3" });

    const onMove = (e: PointerEvent) => {
      xTo(e.clientX);
      yTo(e.clientY);
    };
    window.addEventListener("pointermove", onMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("pointermove", onMove);
  }); // useGSAP reverts the tweens on unmount

  return <div ref={dot} className="pointer-events-none fixed left-0 top-0 size-4 rounded-full bg-black" />;
}
```

For an instant (un-eased) follower, swap in `quickSetter`:

```tsx
const setX = gsap.quickSetter(el, "x", "px");
const setY = gsap.quickSetter(el, "y", "px");
const onMove = (e: PointerEvent) => { setX(e.clientX); setY(e.clientY); };
```

See [React & Next.js](./react-nextjs.md) for the `useGSAP` cleanup pattern.

## ScrollTrigger performance

Scroll runs on the main thread, so scroll-linked work is the most jank-prone surface. Keep it lean:

- **Pin only what's needed.** `pin: true` promotes the pinned element and adds spacing/measurement overhead. Pin the smallest necessary subtree, not whole sections.
- **Smooth scrub on low-end.** Use a numeric `scrub` (e.g. `scrub: 1`) so the timeline catches up over ~1s instead of recomputing on every scroll tick. Test the value on a representative device — too small reintroduces jank.
- **Refresh only on real layout change.** Call `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after content loads or the DOM reflows (images, fonts, async data) — not on every `resize`. Debounce resize-driven refreshes and order them after the layout settles, not on a random timeout.
- **Order with `refreshPriority`.** When triggers depend on each other's positions (e.g. a pinned scene above content that also has triggers), set `refreshPriority` so they recalculate in the right order; higher priority refreshes first.
- **Keep callbacks cheap.** `onUpdate`/`onToggle` run during scroll — no layout reads, no allocations, no heavy work per frame.

```tsx
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: ".panel",
  start: "top top",
  end: "+=1200",
  pin: true,            // promote only this element
  scrub: 1,             // smoothing — gentler on low-end devices
  refreshPriority: 1,   // refresh before lower-priority triggers
});

// After async content changes the layout — debounced, not on raw resize
ScrollTrigger.refresh();
```

See [ScrollTrigger](./scrolltrigger.md) for scene semantics.

## Kill or pause off-screen animations

Animations that aren't visible still consume frame budget. Stop them:

- **Pause** off-screen or background animations (tab hidden, element scrolled away) with an IntersectionObserver or `ScrollTrigger`'s `onToggle`, and resume when visible.
- **Kill** tweens/ScrollTriggers on route change and component unmount so stray instances don't keep ticking. In React, `useGSAP` reverts everything created in its scope automatically.
- Infinite/looping tweens (`repeat: -1`) are the worst offenders when forgotten — they run forever. Always pair them with visibility-gating and cleanup.

```tsx
const io = new IntersectionObserver(([entry]) => {
  entry.isIntersecting ? loopTween.play() : loopTween.pause();
});
io.observe(el);
```

## Reduced motion as a perf + a11y lever

`prefers-reduced-motion` is both an accessibility requirement and a free performance win — honoring it removes the most expensive looping/parallax work for the users who opt out. Treat it as a behavioral branch, not just a shorter duration: skip decorative motion entirely, keep functional feedback, and land elements on a sensible static final state.

```tsx
const mm = gsap.matchMedia();
mm.add("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)", () => {
  gsap.set(".hero", { autoAlpha: 1, y: 0 }); // final state, no movement, no loops
});
mm.add("(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)", () => {
  gsap.from(".hero", { y: 60, autoAlpha: 0, duration: 1 });
  // pinned / parallax / infinite tweens go here so they never run for reduced-motion users
});
```

`matchMedia` auto-reverts everything created in a branch when its query stops matching. See [Core API](./core.md).

## Profiling playbook

Diagnose before you optimize — replacing code without finding the bottleneck wastes effort.

1. **Reproduce with evidence.** Note the affected route, device/browser, and the exact interaction that janks.
2. **Record in DevTools Performance.** Open the Performance panel, throttle CPU (4–6× slowdown) to mimic a mid-range device, record while triggering the animation, and stop.
3. **Read the flame chart.** Look for **long tasks** (>50ms, red-flagged), and recurring **Layout** / **Recalculate Style** entries during the animation — those signal layout thrash from animating layout props or reading geometry mid-frame.
4. **Watch the FPS / frame meter.** Enable the FPS meter (Rendering tab → Frame Rendering Stats). Dropped frames or a frame chart that can't hold the green line means you're over budget.
5. **Classify the cost** as composite, paint, layout, JavaScript, image/decode, or scroll workload (see the [property-cost table](#the-property-cost-mental-model)) before deciding the fix.
6. **Check layers.** Use the Layers panel / "Paint flashing" and "Layer borders" in the Rendering tab to confirm `will-change` promoted the right elements and didn't create an oversized layer.
7. **Capture before/after** for the hot interaction so the fix is provably better, ideally under throttled CPU.

Common culprits and fixes: layout props → swap to transforms; per-frame `getBoundingClientRect` → batch/cache reads; blanket `will-change` → scope and remove it; un-debounced `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` → call only on real layout change.

## Pitfalls / Do-not

- **Do not** animate layout props (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`) when transform aliases (`x`, `y`, `scale`) achieve the same look — they force reflow every frame.
- **Do not** put `will-change` (or `force3D`/`translateZ(0)`) on everything "just in case" — scope it to actively animating elements and remove it after; global will-change hurts more than it helps.
- **Do not** read layout (`offsetWidth`, `getBoundingClientRect`) inside `onUpdate` or scroll callbacks — that thrashes layout on the hot path. Read once, cache, recompute on refresh.
- **Do not** create hundreds of overlapping tweens or ScrollTriggers — use `stagger`, a single timeline, or virtualization, and test on low-end devices.
- **Do not** create a new tween on every mouse/scroll event — reuse one `gsap.quickTo()` / `gsap.quickSetter()`.
- **Do not** forget cleanup — stray tweens, infinite loops, and ScrollTriggers keep running after unmount/navigation, costing frames and causing bugs.
- **Do not** ship infinite tweens (`repeat: -1`) without a reduced-motion branch and visibility-gated pause/kill.
